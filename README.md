Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict the perceived emotions of the speaker from short text snippets. Specifically, the emotions are: joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, and optionally, disgust.

Each text snippet is labeled with multiple emotions (multi-label classification), where:

1 indicates the presence of an emotion.
0 indicates its absence.
Steps Involved:
Dataset Overview:

Training data consists of text snippets and binary labels for each emotion.
Test data includes text snippets for which we predict emotion labels.
Modeling Approach:

Use a pre-trained BERT model (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
Fine-tune BERT for multi-label classification with one output unit per emotion.
Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing:
Tokenize the text into numerical embeddings using the BERT tokenizer.
Training:
Fine-tune the BERT model on the training dataset.
Optimize with binary cross-entropy loss for multi-label classification.
Evaluation:
Assess performance on a validation set (accuracy and loss).
Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict emotion labels for test data.
Output:

A file containing each test snippet and its predicted emotion labels.
Applications:
Sentiment analysis in social media, customer reviews, or conversational AI.
Enhancing human-computer interaction by understanding emotional context.
